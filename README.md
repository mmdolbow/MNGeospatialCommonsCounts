This is a repo for demonstrating how to use the CKAN API to obtain general counts from a CKAN site, using the MN Geospatial Commons (gisdata.mn.gov) as the subject.

HAS:
- Basic total package (resource) count
- Count of organizations (publishers)
- List of publishers with a count of their total resources
- Decent Bootstrap table style
- List and link of recently created resources at the bottom (but only if a new resource exists in the list of the most recent 150 modified)

NEEDS:
- Sorting of bootstrap table
- More responsive style for larger screens
